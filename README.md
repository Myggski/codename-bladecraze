# codename-bladecraze
This project, which is a clone of the classic game Bomberman, was created in Lua using the Löve2D game framework. The objective of this local 2-4 player multiplayer game is to be the last person standing and eliminate all other players.

## Special Thanks

The music that we use in this project is created by [Zane Little](https://opengameart.org/users/zane-little-music) and thanks to him we were able to significantly enhance the game's feel.

We also use the Silver font by [Poppy](https://poppyworks.itch.io/silver) which improves the text of our buttons.
