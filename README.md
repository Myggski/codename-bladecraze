# codename-bladecraze
This project was made to get a better knowledge for Lua, and having fun at the same time. That's why we decided to make a Bomberman clone in LÖVE2D. 

The project is made by Tomas Wallin ([@Myggski](https://github.com/Myggski)) and David Bång ([@Sodaro](https://github.com/Sodaro)).
